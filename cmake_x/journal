Created the cmake_x directory to exercise cmake skills.
Practicing following commands:
	cmake_minimum_required()

When I run "cmake ." to run CMakeLists.txt, I got following error:
-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.   Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.

Then the solution is presented here:
