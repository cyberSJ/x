---------------- 3/3/2015 is down.
Created the cmake_x directory to exercise cmake skills.
Practicing following commands:
	cmake_minimum_required()
	project()

----------------

When I run "cmake ." to run CMakeLists.txt, I got following error:
-- The CXX compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error: your CXX compiler: "CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER-NOTFOUND" was not found.   Please set CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER to a valid compiler path or name.

Then the solution is presented here:

What does it mean "source" in CMake?
By looking at this error: 
CMake Error: The source "/home/sung/repo/x/cmake_x/cmake/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/sung/repo/x/cmake_x/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.

"source" means CMakeLists.txt file. That "source" generates cache related to CMake.

----------------

When the CMakeLists.txt is moved to different directory, I think the cache that remembered the previous CMakeLists.txt file location needs to be updated.

---------------

It's generally a good idea to make CMakeLists.txt to live under a directory called "cmake". I'm not sure why yet, but that "cmake" directoy is going to include files relate to cmake, such as .cmake modules.

Question: How do you not manuaully specify **/cmake when you include a
CMakeLists.txt?
