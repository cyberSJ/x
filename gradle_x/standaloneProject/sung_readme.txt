The example here is fetched from:
https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/custom_tasks.html#sec:custom_tasks_standalone_project.

There are ___ parts in this session:
    1. Build script for a standalone project.
    2. Code that uses the standalone project.

Once a groovy code (GreetingTask.groovy) can be built, the .class file generated
for the groovy class can be referenced in the classpath of the build.gradle
build script.
